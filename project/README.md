# How to run the project?
The dataset contains around 4GB so it is recommended to download it from the competition webpage - [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2019/data).
Then, `src/` directory contains a python script `generate_features.py` which creates a summarisation of the original dataset.
Rest of the code is written in R scripts which operate on the data generated by python script.
All the dataset files are expected to be placed in directory `input/data-science-bowl-2019/`.
The report describing this work can be found in the `report/` directory.
